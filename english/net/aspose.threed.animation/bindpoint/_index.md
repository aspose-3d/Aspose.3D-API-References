## BindPoint class

A [`BindPoint`](../bindpoint) is usually created on an object's property, some property types contains multiple component fields(like a Vector3 field), [`BindPoint`](../bindpoint) will generate channel for each component field and connects the field to one or more keyframe sequence instance(s) through the channels.

```csharp
public class BindPoint : A3DObject
```

## Constructors
