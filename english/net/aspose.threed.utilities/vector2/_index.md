## Vector2 structure

A vector with two components.

```csharp
public struct Vector2 : IComparable<Vector2>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Vector2](vector2)(double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](../vector2) struct. |
| [Vector2](vector2)(FVector2) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](../vector2) struct. |
| [Vector2](vector2)(double, double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](../vector2) struct. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Length](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/length) { get; } | Gets the length. |
| [U](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/u) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the U component if the [`Vector2`](../vector2) is used as a mapping coordinate. It's an alias of x component. |
| [V](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/v) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the V component if the [`Vector2`](../vector2) is used as a mapping coordinate. It's an alias of y component. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CompareTo](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/compareto)(Vector2) | Compare current vector to another instance. |
| [Cross](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/cross)(Vector2) | Cross product of two vectors |
| [Dot](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/dot)(Vector2) | Gets the dot product of two vectors |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/equals)(object) | Check if two vector2 equals |
| [Equals](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/equals)(Vector2) | Check if two vector2 equals |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/gethashcode)() | Gets the hash code of Vector2 |
| [Normalize](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/normalize)() | Normalizes this instance. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/tostring)() | Returns a String that represents the current [`Vector2`](../vector2). |
| [operator +](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/op_addition) | Addition operator for Vector2 |
| [operator /](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/op_division) | Division operator for Vector2 |
| [operator ==](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/op_equality) | Equal operator for Vector2 |
| [explicit operator](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/op_explicit) |  |
| [operator !=](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/op_inequality) | Not-equal operator for Vector2 |
| [operator *](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/op_multiply) | Multiply operator for Vector2 (2 operators) |
| [operator -](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/op_subtraction) | Subtraction operator for Vector2 |

## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [x](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/x) | The x component. |
| [y](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/y) | The y component. |
