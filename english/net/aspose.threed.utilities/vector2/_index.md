## Vector2 structure

A vector with two components.

```csharp
public struct Vector2 : IComparable<Vector2>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Vector2](vector2)(double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](../vector2) struct. |
| [Vector2](vector2)(FVector2) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](../vector2) struct. |
| [Vector2](vector2)(double, double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](../vector2) struct. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Length](length) { get; } | Gets the length. |
| [U](u) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the U component if the [`Vector2`](../vector2) is used as a mapping coordinate. It's an alias of x component. |
| [V](v) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the V component if the [`Vector2`](../vector2) is used as a mapping coordinate. It's an alias of y component. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CompareTo](compareto)(Vector2) | Compare current vector to another instance. |
| [Cross](cross)(Vector2) | Cross product of two vectors |
| [Dot](dot)(Vector2) | Gets the dot product of two vectors |
| override [Equals](equals)(object) | Check if two vector2 equals |
| [Equals](equals)(Vector2) | Check if two vector2 equals |
| override [GetHashCode](gethashcode)() | Gets the hash code of Vector2 |
| [Normalize](normalize)() | Normalizes this instance. |
| override [ToString](tostring)() | Returns a String that represents the current [`Vector2`](../vector2). |
| [operator +](op_addition) | Addition operator for Vector2 |
| [operator /](op_division) | Division operator for Vector2 |
| [operator ==](op_equality) | Equal operator for Vector2 |
| [explicit operator](op_explicit) |  |
| [operator !=](op_inequality) | Not-equal operator for Vector2 |
| [operator *](op_multiply) | Multiply operator for Vector2 (2 operators) |
| [operator -](op_subtraction) | Subtraction operator for Vector2 |

## Other Members

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [x](x) | The x component. |
| [y](y) | The y component. |
