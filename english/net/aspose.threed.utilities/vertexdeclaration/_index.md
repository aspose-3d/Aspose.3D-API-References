## VertexDeclaration class

The declaration of a custom defined vertex's structure

```csharp

```

## Constructors

| --- | --- |
| [VertexDeclaration](vertexdeclaration)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Count](count) { get; } | Gets the count of all fields defined in this [`VertexDeclaration`](../vertexdeclaration) |
| [Item](item) { get; } |  |
| [Sealed](sealed) { get; } | A [`VertexDeclaration`](../vertexdeclaration) will be sealed when its been used by [`TriMesh`](../../aspose.threed.entities/trimesh-1) or [`TriMesh`](../../aspose.threed.entities/trimesh), no more modifications is allowed. |
| [Size](size) { get; } | The size in byte of the vertex structure. |

| [AddField](addfield)(VertexFieldDataType, VertexFieldSemantic, int, string) | Add a new vertex field |
| [Clear](clear)() | Clear all fields. |
| [CompareTo](compareto)(VertexDeclaration) | Compares this instance to a specified object and returns an indication of their relative values. |
| override [Equals](equals)(object) | Determines whether this instance and a specified object, which must also be a [`VertexDeclaration`](../vertexdeclaration) object, have the same value. |
