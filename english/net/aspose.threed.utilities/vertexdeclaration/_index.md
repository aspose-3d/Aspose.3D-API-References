## VertexDeclaration class

The declaration of a custom defined vertex's structure

```csharp
public sealed class VertexDeclaration : IComparable<VertexDeclaration>, IEnumerable<VertexField>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [VertexDeclaration](vertexdeclaration)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Count](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/count) { get; } | Gets the count of all fields defined in this [`VertexDeclaration`](../vertexdeclaration) |
| [Item](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/item) { get; } |  |
| [Sealed](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/sealed) { get; } | A [`VertexDeclaration`](../vertexdeclaration) will be sealed when its been used by [`TriMesh`](../../aspose.threed.entities/trimesh-1) or [`TriMesh`](../../aspose.threed.entities/trimesh), no more modifications is allowed. |
| [Size](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/size) { get; } | The size in byte of the vertex structure. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FromGeometry](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/fromgeometry)(Geometry, bool) | Create a [`VertexDeclaration`](../vertexdeclaration) based on a [`Geometry`](../../aspose.threed.entities/geometry)'s layout. |
| static [FromType&lt;T&gt;](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/fromtype)() |  |
| [AddField](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/addfield)(VertexFieldDataType, VertexFieldSemantic, int, string) | Add a new vertex field |
| [Clear](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/clear)() | Clear all fields. |
| [CompareTo](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/compareto)(VertexDeclaration) | Compares this instance to a specified object and returns an indication of their relative values. |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/equals)(object) | Determines whether this instance and a specified object, which must also be a [`VertexDeclaration`](../vertexdeclaration) object, have the same value. |
| [GetEnumerator](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/getenumerator)() | Gets an enumerator to walk through all vertex fields in this instance. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/gethashcode)() | Returns the hash code for this string. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration/tostring)() | String representation of [`VertexDeclaration`](../vertexdeclaration) |
