## Quaternion structure

Quaternion is usually used to perform rotation in computer graphics.

```csharp
public struct Quaternion
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Quaternion](quaternion)(double, double, double, double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Quaternion`](../quaternion) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Length](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/length) { get; } | Gets the length of the quaternion |

## Methods

| Name | Description |

| override [Equals](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/equals)(object) | Check if two quaternions equals |
| [EulerAngles](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/eulerangles)() | Converts quaternion to rotation represented by Euler angles All components are in radian |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/gethashcode)() | Gets the hash code of Quaternion |
| [Inverse](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/inverse)() | Returns a inverse quaternion of current quaternion |
| [Normalize](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/normalize)() | Normalize the quaternion |
| [ToAngleAxis](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/toangleaxis)(out double, out Vector3) |  |
| [ToMatrix](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/tomatrix)() | Convert the rotation presented by quaternion to transform matrix. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/tostring)() | Gets the representation of quaternion in string |
| [operator +](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/op_addition) | Operator overloading for + |
| [operator /](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/op_division) | Operator overloading for / |
| [operator ==](../../aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion/op_equality) | Equal operator for quaternion |
