## FVector2 structure

A float vector with two components.

```csharp
public struct FVector2
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FVector2](fvector2/#constructor)(Vector2) | Initializes a new instance of the `FVector2`. |
| [FVector2](fvector2/#constructor_1)(float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the `FVector2`. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Equals](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector2/equals/#equals)(FVector2) | Check if two vectors are equal |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector2/equals/#equals_1)(object) | Check if two vectors are equal |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector2/gethashcode/)() | Gets the hash code of this instance |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector2/tostring/)() | Returns a string that represents the `FVector2` |
| [operator +](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector2/op_addition/) | + Operator overloading |
| [operator ==](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector2/op_equality/) | == Operator overloading |
| [explicit operator](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector2/op_explicit/) |  |
