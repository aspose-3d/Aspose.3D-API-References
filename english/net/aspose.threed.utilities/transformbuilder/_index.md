## TransformBuilder class

The [`TransformBuilder`](../transformbuilder) is used to build transform matrix by a chain of transformations.

```csharp
public class TransformBuilder
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [TransformBuilder](transformbuilder)(ComposeOrder) | Construct a [`TransformBuilder`](../transformbuilder) with initial identity transform matrix and specified compose order |
| [TransformBuilder](transformbuilder)(Matrix4, ComposeOrder) | Construct a [`TransformBuilder`](../transformbuilder) with initial transform matrix and specified compose order |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ComposeOrder](../../aspose.threed.utilities/transformbuilder/composeorder) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the chain compose order. |
| [Matrix](../../aspose.threed.utilities/transformbuilder/matrix) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the current matrix value |

## Methods
