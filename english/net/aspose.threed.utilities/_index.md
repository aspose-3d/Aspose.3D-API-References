## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DummyFileSystem](./dummyfilesystem) | Read/write operations are dummy operations. |
| [FileSystem](./filesystem) | File system encapsulation. Aspose.3D will use this to read/write dependencies. |
| [IOUtils](./ioutils) | Utilities to write matrix/vector to binary writer |
| [LocalFileSystem](./localfilesystem) | The [`LocalFileSystem`](aspose.threed.utilities/localfilesystem) will maps the read/write operations to local directory. |
| [MathUtils](./mathutils) | A set of useful mathematical utilities. |
| [MemoryFileSystem](./memoryfilesystem) | The [`MemoryFileSystem`](aspose.threed.utilities/memoryfilesystem) will maps the read/write operations to memory. |
| [ParseException](./parseexception) | Exception when Aspose.3D failed to parse the input. |
| [SemanticAttribute](./semanticattribute) | Allow user to use their own structure for static declaration of [`VertexDeclaration`](aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration) |
| [TransformBuilder](./transformbuilder) | The [`TransformBuilder`](aspose.threed.utilities/transformbuilder) is used to build transform matrix by a chain of transformations. |
| [Vertex](./vertex) | Vertex reference, used to access the raw vertex in [`TriMesh`](aspose.threed.entities/trimesh). |
| [VertexDeclaration](./vertexdeclaration) | The declaration of a custom defined vertex's structure |
| [VertexField](./vertexfield) | Vertex's field memory layout description. |
| [Watermark](./watermark) | Utility to encode/decode blind watermark to/from a mesh. |
| [ZipArchiveFileSystem](./ziparchivefilesystem) | File system to provide to the read-only access to speicified zip file or zip stream. File system will be disposed after the open/save operation. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IArrayList&lt;T&gt;](./iarraylist-1) | Aspose.3D has its own highly optimized implementation of List for better loading/saving performance Only this interface is exposed for user with IList compatible and similar interfaces. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BoundingBoxExtent](./boundingboxextent) | The extent of the bounding box |
| [ComposeOrder](./composeorder) | The order to compose transform matrix |
| [VertexFieldDataType](./vertexfielddatatype) | Vertex field's data type |
| [VertexFieldSemantic](./vertexfieldsemantic) | The semantic of the vertex field |
