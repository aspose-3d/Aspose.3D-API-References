## Vector3.AngleBetween method (1 of 2)

Calculate the inner angle between two direction Two direction can be non-normalized vectors

```csharp
public double AngleBetween(Vector3 dir, Vector3 up)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dir | Vector3 | The direction vector to compare with |
| up | Vector3 | The up vector of the two direction's shared plane |

### Return Value

inner angle in radian
