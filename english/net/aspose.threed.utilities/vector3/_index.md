## Vector3 structure

A vector with three components.

```csharp
public struct Vector3 : IComparable<Vector3>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Vector3](vector3)(double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector3`](../vector3) struct. |
| [Vector3](vector3)(FVector3) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector3`](../vector3) struct. |
| [Vector3](vector3)(Vector4) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector3`](../vector3) struct. |
| [Vector3](vector3)(double, double, double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector3`](../vector3) struct. |
