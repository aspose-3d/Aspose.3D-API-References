## FVector3 structure

A float vector with three components.

```csharp
public struct FVector3
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FVector3](fvector3)(Vector3) | Initializes a new instance of the [`FVector3`](../fvector3). |
| [FVector3](fvector3)(Vector4) | Initializes a new instance of the [`FVector4`](../fvector4). |
| [FVector3](fvector3)(float, float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the [`FVector3`](../fvector3). |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [One](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/one) { get; } | The unit scale vector with all components are all 1 |
| static [Zero](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/zero) { get; } | The Zero vector. |

## Methods
