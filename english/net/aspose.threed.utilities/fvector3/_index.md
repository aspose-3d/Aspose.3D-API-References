## FVector3 structure

A float vector with three components.

```csharp
public struct FVector3
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FVector3](fvector3/#constructor)(Vector3) | Initializes a new instance of the `FVector3`. |
| [FVector3](fvector3/#constructor_1)(Vector4) | Initializes a new instance of the [`FVector4`](../fvector4/). |
| [FVector3](fvector3/#constructor_2)(float, float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the `FVector3`. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [One](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/one/) { get; } | The unit scale vector with all components are all 1 |
| static [Zero](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/zero/) { get; } | The Zero vector. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Cross](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/cross/)(FVector3) | Cross product of two vectors |
| [Normalize](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/normalize/)() | Normalizes this instance. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/tostring/)() | Returns a string that represents the `FVector3` |
| [operator +](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/op_addition/) | + Operator overloading |
| [explicit operator](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/op_explicit/) |  |
| [operator *](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/op_multiply/) | * Operator overloading |
| [operator -](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/op_subtraction/) | - Operator overloading (2 operators) |

## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [X](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/x/) | The x component. |
| [Y](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/y/) | The y component. |
| [Z](../../aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/z/) | The y component. |
