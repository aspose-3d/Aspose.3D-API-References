## Mesh.Optimize method

Optimize the mesh's memory usage by eliminating duplicated control points

```csharp
public Mesh Optimize(bool vertexElements)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vertexElements | Boolean | Optimize duplicated vertex element data |

### Return Value

New mesh instance with compact memory usage

### Examples

The following code shows how to eliminate duplicated control points from an unoptimized mesh:

```csharp
//Sphere.ToMesh generates 117 control points
var mesh = (new Sphere()).ToMesh();
//After optimized, there're only 86 control points, polygon indices are also remapped.
var optimized = mesh.Optimize(true);
```
