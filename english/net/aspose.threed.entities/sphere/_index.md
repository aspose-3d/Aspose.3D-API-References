## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Sphere](sphere)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`Sphere`](../sphere) with default radius 1. |
| [Sphere](sphere)(double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Sphere`](../sphere) class with specified radius. |
| [Sphere](sphere)(double, int, int) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Sphere`](../sphere) class with specified radius, width segments and height segments. |
| [Sphere](sphere)(string, double, int, int, double, double, double, double) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Sphere`](../sphere) class. |
