## Frustum class

The base class of [`Camera`](../camera) and [`Light`](../light)

```csharp
public abstract class Frustum : Entity, IOrientable
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Aspect](aspect) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the aspect ratio of the frustum |
| [Direction](direction) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the direction that the camera is looking at. Changes on this property will also affects the [`LookAt`](./lookat) and [`Target`](./target). |
| [Excluded](excluded) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| [FarPlane](farplane) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's far plane distance. |
| [LookAt](lookat) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the the interested position that the camera is looking at. |
| virtual [Name](name) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name. |
| [NearPlane](nearplane) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's near plane distance. |
| [OrthoHeight](orthoheight) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the height when frustum in orthographic projection. |
| [ParentNode](parentnode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [ParentNodes](parentnodes) { get; } | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [Properties](properties) { get; } | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [RotationMode](rotationmode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's orientation mode This property only works when the [`Target`](./target) is null. If the value is FixedTarget, the direction is always calculated by the property [`LookAt`](./lookat) Otherwise the [`LookAt`](./lookat) is always calculated by the [`Direction`](./direction) |
| [Scene](scene) { get; } | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [Target](target) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the target that the camera is looking at. If the user supports this property, it should be prior to [`LookAt`](./lookat) property. |
| [Up](up) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the up direction of the camera |
