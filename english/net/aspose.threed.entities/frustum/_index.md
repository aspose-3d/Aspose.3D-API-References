## Frustum class

The base class of [`Camera`](../camera) and [`Light`](../light)

```csharp
public abstract class Frustum : Entity, IOrientable
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Aspect](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/aspect) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the aspect ratio of the frustum |
| [Direction](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/direction) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the direction that the camera is looking at. Changes on this property will also affects the [`LookAt`](./lookat) and [`Target`](./target). |
| [Excluded](../../aspose.threed/entity/excluded) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| [FarPlane](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/farplane) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's far plane distance. |
| [LookAt](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/lookat) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the the interested position that the camera is looking at. |
| virtual [Name](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/name) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name. |
| [NearPlane](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/nearplane) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's near plane distance. |
| [OrthoHeight](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/orthoheight) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the height when frustum in orthographic projection. |
| [ParentNode](../../aspose.threed/entity/parentnode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [ParentNodes](../../aspose.threed/entity/parentnodes) { get; } | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [Properties](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/properties) { get; } | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [RotationMode](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/rotationmode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's orientation mode This property only works when the [`Target`](./target) is null. If the value is FixedTarget, the direction is always calculated by the property [`LookAt`](./lookat) Otherwise the [`LookAt`](./lookat) is always calculated by the [`Direction`](./direction) |
| [Scene](../../aspose.threed/sceneobject/scene) { get; } | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [Target](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/target) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the target that the camera is looking at. If the user supports this property, it should be prior to [`LookAt`](./lookat) property. |
| [Up](../../aspose.threed.entities/frustum/up) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the up direction of the camera |
