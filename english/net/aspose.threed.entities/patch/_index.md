## Patch class

A [`Patch`](../patch) is a parametric modeling surface, similar to [`NurbsSurface`](../nurbssurface), it's also defined by two [`PatchDirection`](../patchdirection), the [`U`](./u) and [`V`](./v). But difference between [`Patch`](../patch) and [`NurbsSurface`](../nurbssurface) is that the [`PatchDirection`](../patchdirection) curve can be one of Bezier, QuadraticBezier, BasisSpline, CardinalSpline and Linear

```csharp
public class Patch : Geometry
```
