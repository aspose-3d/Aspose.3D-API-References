## NurbsDirection class

A 3D [`NurbsSurface`](../nurbssurface) has two direction, the [`U`](../nurbssurface/u) and [`V`](../nurbssurface/v), the [`NurbsDirection`](../nurbsdirection) defines data for each direction. A direction is actually a NURBS curve, that means it's also defined by its [`Order`](./order), a [`KnotVectors`](./knotvectors), and a set of weighted control points(defined in [`NurbsSurface`](../nurbssurface)).

```csharp
public class NurbsDirection
```

## Constructors

| [NurbsDirection](nurbsdirection)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Count](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbsdirection/count) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the count of control points in current direction. |
| [Divisions](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbsdirection/divisions) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of divisions between adjacent control points in current direction. |
| [KnotVectors](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbsdirection/knotvectors) { get; } | Gets the knot vector, it is a sequence of parameter values that determines where and how the control points affect the NURBS curve. |
| [Multiplicity](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbsdirection/multiplicity) { get; } | Gets the multiplicity. |
| [Order](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbsdirection/order) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the order of a NURBS curve, it defines the number of nearby control points that influence any given point on the curve. |
| [Type](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbsdirection/type) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the type of the current direction. |
