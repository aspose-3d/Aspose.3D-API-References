## Skeleton class

The [`Skeleton`](../skeleton) is mainly used by CAD software to help designer to manipulate the transformation of skeletal structure, it's usually useless outside the CAD softwares. To make the skeleton hierarchy acts like one object in CAD software, it's necessary to mark the top [`Skeleton`](../skeleton) node as the root one by setting [`Type`](./type) to Skeleton, and all children set to Bone

```csharp
public class Skeleton : Entity
```
