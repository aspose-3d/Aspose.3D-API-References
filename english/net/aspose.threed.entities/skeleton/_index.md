## Skeleton class

The [`Skeleton`](../skeleton) is mainly used by CAD software to help designer to manipulate the transformation of skeletal structure, it's usually useless outside the CAD softwares. To make the skeleton hierarchy acts like one object in CAD software, it's necessary to mark the top [`Skeleton`](../skeleton) node as the root one by setting [`Type`](./type) to Skeleton, and all children set to Bone

```csharp
public class Skeleton : Entity
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |

| virtual [Name](name) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name. |
| [ParentNode](parentnode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [ParentNodes](parentnodes) { get; } | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [Properties](properties) { get; } | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [Scene](scene) { get; } | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [Size](size) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the limb node size that used in CAD software to represent the size of the bone. |
