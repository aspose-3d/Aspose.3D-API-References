## Camera class

The camera describes the eye point of the viewer looking at the scene.

```csharp
public class Camera : Frustum
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Camera](camera)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`Camera`](../camera) class. |
| [Camera](camera)(ProjectionType) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Camera`](../camera) class. |
| [Camera](camera)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Camera`](../camera) class. |
| [Camera](camera)(string, ProjectionType) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Camera`](../camera) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ApertureMode](aperturemode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the camera's aperture mode |
| [Aspect](aspect) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the aspect ratio of the frustum |
| [AspectRatio](aspectratio) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the view plane aspect ratio. |
| [Direction](direction) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the direction that the camera is looking at. Changes on this property will also affects the [`LookAt`](../frustum/lookat) and [`Target`](../frustum/target). |
| [Excluded](excluded) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| [FarPlane](farplane) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's far plane distance. |
| [FieldOfView](fieldofview) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the camera's field of view in degrees, this property is used only when ApertureMode is Horizontal or Vertical |
| [FieldOfViewX](fieldofviewx) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the camera's horizontal field of view in degrees, this property is used only when ApertureMode is HorizAndVert |
| [FieldOfViewY](fieldofviewy) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the camera's vertical field of view in degrees, this property is used only when ApertureMode is HorizAndVert |
| [Height](height) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the view plane's height measured in inches |
| [LookAt](lookat) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the the interested position that the camera is looking at. |
| [Magnification](magnification) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the magnification used in orthographic camera |
| virtual [Name](name) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name. |
| [NearPlane](nearplane) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's near plane distance. |
| [OrthoHeight](orthoheight) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the height when frustum in orthographic projection. |
| [ParentNode](parentnode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [ParentNodes](parentnodes) { get; } | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [ProjectionType](projectiontype) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the camera's projection type. By default the perspective projection is used. |
| [Properties](properties) { get; } | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [RotationMode](rotationmode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the frustum's orientation mode This property only works when the [`Target`](../frustum/target) is null. If the value is FixedTarget, the direction is always calculated by the property [`LookAt`](../frustum/lookat) Otherwise the [`LookAt`](../frustum/lookat) is always calculated by the [`Direction`](../frustum/direction) |
| [Scene](scene) { get; } | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [Target](target) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the target that the camera is looking at. If the user supports this property, it should be prior to [`LookAt`](../frustum/lookat) property. |
| [Up](up) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the up direction of the camera |
| [Width](width) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the view plane's width measured in inches |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FindProperty](findproperty)(string) | Finds the property. It can be a dynamic property (Created by CreateDynamicProperty/SetProperty) or native property(Identified by its name) |
| [GetBoundingBox](getboundingbox)() | Gets the bounding box of current entity in its object space coordinate system. |
| virtual [GetEntityRendererKey](getentityrendererkey)() | Gets the key of the entity renderer registered in the renderer |
| [GetProperty](getproperty)(string) | Get the value of specified property |
| [MoveForward](moveforward)(double) | Move camera forward towards its direction or target. |
| [RemoveProperty](removeproperty)(Property) | Removes a dynamic property. |
| [RemoveProperty](removeproperty)(string) | Remove the specified property identified by name |
| [SetProperty](setproperty)(string, object) | Sets the value of specified property |
