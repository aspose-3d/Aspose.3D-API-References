## NurbsSurface class

[`NurbsSurface`](../nurbssurface) is a surface represented by [NURBS(Non-uniform rational basis spline)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline), A [`NurbsSurface`](../nurbssurface) is defined by two [`NurbsDirection`](../nurbsdirection)[`U`](./u) and [`V`](./v). The w component in control point is used as control point's weight whatever the direction's type is a TwoDimensional or ThreeDimensional

```csharp
public class NurbsSurface : Geometry, IMeshConvertible
```
