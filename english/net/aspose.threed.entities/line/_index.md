## Line class

A polyline is a path defined by a set of points with [`ControlPoints`](../geometry/controlpoints), and connected by [`Segments`](./segments), which means it can also be a set of connected line segments. The line is usually a linear object, which means it cannot be used to represent a curve, in order to represent a curve, uses [`NurbsCurve`](../nurbscurve).

```csharp
public class Line : Curve
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Line](line)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`Line`](../line) class. |
| [Line](line)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Line`](../line) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ControlPoints](controlpoints) { get; } | Gets all control points |
| [Segments](segments) { get; } | Gets the segments of the line |
| [Visible](visible) { get; set; } | Gets or sets if the geometry is visible |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FromPoints](frompoints)(params Vector3[]) | Construct a [`Line`](../line) instance from a set of points. |
| [MakeDefaultIndices](makedefaultindices)() | Generate the sequence 0,1,2,3....[`ControlPoints`](../geometry/controlpoints).Length-1 to [`Segments`](./segments) so the ControlPoints can be used as a single line |
