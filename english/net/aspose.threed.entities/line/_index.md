## Line class

A polyline is a path defined by a set of points with [`ControlPoints`](../geometry/controlpoints), and connected by [`Segments`](./segments), which means it can also be a set of connected line segments. The line is usually a linear object, which means it cannot be used to represent a curve, in order to represent a curve, uses [`NurbsCurve`](../nurbscurve).

```csharp
public class Line : Curve
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Line](line)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`Line`](../line) class. |
| [Line](line)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Line`](../line) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Color](color) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the color of the line, default value is white(1, 1, 1) |
| [ControlPoints](controlpoints) { get; } | Gets all control points |
| [Excluded](excluded) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| virtual [Name](name) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name. |
| [ParentNode](parentnode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [ParentNodes](parentnodes) { get; } | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [Properties](properties) { get; } | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [Scene](scene) { get; } | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [Segments](segments) { get; } | Gets the segments of the line |
| [Visible](visible) { get; set; } | Gets or sets if the geometry is visible |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FromPoints](frompoints)(params Vector3[]) | Construct a [`Line`](../line) instance from a set of points. |
| [FindProperty](findproperty)(string) | Finds the property. It can be a dynamic property (Created by CreateDynamicProperty/SetProperty) or native property(Identified by its name) |
| [GetBoundingBox](getboundingbox)() | Gets the bounding box of current entity in its object space coordinate system. |
| override [GetEntityRendererKey](getentityrendererkey)() | Gets the key of the entity renderer registered in the renderer |
| [GetProperty](getproperty)(string) | Get the value of specified property |
| [MakeDefaultIndices](makedefaultindices)() | Generate the sequence 0,1,2,3....[`ControlPoints`](../geometry/controlpoints).Length-1 to [`Segments`](./segments) so the ControlPoints can be used as a single line |
| [RemoveProperty](removeproperty)(Property) | Removes a dynamic property. |
| [RemoveProperty](removeproperty)(string) | Remove the specified property identified by name |
| [SetProperty](setproperty)(string, object) | Sets the value of specified property |
