## Shape class

The shape describes the deformation on a set of control points, which is similar to the cluster deformer in Maya. For example, we can add a shape to a created geometry. And the shape and the geometry have the same topological information but different position of the control points. With varying amounts of influence, the geometry performs a deformation effect.

```csharp
public class Shape : Geometry
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Shape](shape)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`Shape`](../shape) class. |
| [Shape](shape)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Shape`](../shape) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Indices](indices) { get; } | Gets the indices. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FromControlPoints](fromcontrolpoints)(params Vector3[]) | Create a shape with specified control points with a default indices. |
