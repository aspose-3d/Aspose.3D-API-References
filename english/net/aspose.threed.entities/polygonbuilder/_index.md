## PolygonBuilder class

A helper class to build polygon for [`Mesh`](../mesh)

```csharp
public sealed class PolygonBuilder
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PolygonBuilder](polygonbuilder)(Mesh) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PolygonBuilder`](../polygonbuilder) class. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AddVertex](addvertex)(int) | Adds a vertex index to the polygon |
| [Begin](begin)() | Begins to add a new polygon |
| [End](end)() | Finishes the polygon creation |

### Examples

```csharp
PolygonBuilder builder = new PolygonBuilder(mesh);
builder.Begin();
builder.AddVertex(0);
builder.AddVertex(1);
builder.AddVertex(2);
Builder.End();
```

Equals to :

```csharp
int[] indices = new int[] {0, 1, 2};
mesh.CreatePolygon(indices);
```

If all indices are ready to use, [`CreatePolygon`](../mesh/createpolygon) is preferred, otherwise [`PolygonBuilder`](../polygonbuilder) would be a better choice.
