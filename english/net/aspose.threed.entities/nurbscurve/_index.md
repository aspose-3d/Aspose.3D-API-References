## NurbsCurve class

[NURBS curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline) is a curve represented by NURBS(Non-uniform rational basis spline), A NURBS curve is defined by its [`Order`](./order), a set of weighted [`ControlPoints`](../geometry/controlpoints) and a [`KnotVectors`](./knotvectors) The w component in control point is used as control point's weight, whatever it is a TwoDimensional or ThreeDimensional

```csharp
public class NurbsCurve : Curve
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [NurbsCurve](nurbscurve)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`NurbsCurve`](../nurbscurve) class. |
| [NurbsCurve](nurbscurve)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`NurbsCurve`](../nurbscurve) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ControlPoints](controlpoints) { get; } | Gets all control points |
| [CurveType](curvetype) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the type of the curve. |
| [Dimension](dimension) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the curve's dimension. |
| [KnotVectors](knotvectors) { get; } | Gets the knot vector, it is a sequence of parameter values that determines where and how the control points affect the NURBS curve. |
| [Multiplicity](multiplicity) { get; } | Gets the multiplicity. |
| [Order](order) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the order of a NURBS curve, it defines the number of nearby control points that influence any given point on the curve. |
| [Rational](rational) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether it is rational, this value indicates whether this [`NurbsCurve`](../nurbscurve) is rational spline or non-rational spline. Non-rational B-spline is a special case of rational B-splines. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Evaluate](evaluate)(int) | Evaluate the NURBS curve |
| [EvaluateAt](evaluateat)(double) | Evaluate the curve's point at specified position |
