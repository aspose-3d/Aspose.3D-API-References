## NurbsCurve class

[NURBS curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline) is a curve represented by NURBS(Non-uniform rational basis spline), A NURBS curve is defined by its [`Order`](./order), a set of weighted [`ControlPoints`](../geometry/controlpoints) and a [`KnotVectors`](./knotvectors) The w component in control point is used as control point's weight, whatever it is a TwoDimensional or ThreeDimensional

```csharp
public class NurbsCurve : Curve
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [NurbsCurve](nurbscurve)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`NurbsCurve`](../nurbscurve) class. |
| [NurbsCurve](nurbscurve)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`NurbsCurve`](../nurbscurve) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Color](../../aspose.threed.entities/curve/color) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the color of the line, default value is white(1, 1, 1) |
| [ControlPoints](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/controlpoints) { get; } | Gets all control points |
| [CurveType](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/curvetype) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the type of the curve. |
| [Dimension](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/dimension) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the curve's dimension. |
| [Excluded](../../aspose.threed/entity/excluded) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| [KnotVectors](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/knotvectors) { get; } | Gets the knot vector, it is a sequence of parameter values that determines where and how the control points affect the NURBS curve. |
| [Multiplicity](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/multiplicity) { get; } | Gets the multiplicity. |
| virtual [Name](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/name) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name. |
| [Order](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/order) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the order of a NURBS curve, it defines the number of nearby control points that influence any given point on the curve. |
| [ParentNode](../../aspose.threed/entity/parentnode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [ParentNodes](../../aspose.threed/entity/parentnodes) { get; } | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [Properties](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/properties) { get; } | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [Rational](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/rational) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether it is rational, this value indicates whether this [`NurbsCurve`](../nurbscurve) is rational spline or non-rational spline. Non-rational B-spline is a special case of rational B-splines. |
| [Scene](../../aspose.threed/sceneobject/scene) { get; } | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Evaluate](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/evaluate)(int) | Evaluate the NURBS curve |
| [EvaluateAt](../../aspose.threed.entities/nurbscurve/evaluateat)(double) | Evaluate the curve's point at specified position |
| [FindProperty](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/findproperty)(string) | Finds the property. It can be a dynamic property (Created by CreateDynamicProperty/SetProperty) or native property(Identified by its name) |
| [GetBoundingBox](../../aspose.threed/entity/getboundingbox)() | Gets the bounding box of current entity in its object space coordinate system. |
| override [GetEntityRendererKey](../../aspose.threed.entities/curve/getentityrendererkey)() | Gets the key of the entity renderer registered in the renderer |
| [GetProperty](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/getproperty)(string) | Get the value of specified property |
| [RemoveProperty](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/removeproperty)(Property) | Removes a dynamic property. |
| [RemoveProperty](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/removeproperty)(string) | Remove the specified property identified by name |
| [SetProperty](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/setproperty)(string, object) | Sets the value of specified property |
