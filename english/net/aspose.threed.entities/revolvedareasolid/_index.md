## RevolvedAreaSolid class

This class represents a solid model by revolving a cross section provided by a profile about an axis.

```csharp
public class RevolvedAreaSolid : Entity, IMeshConvertible
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [RevolvedAreaSolid](revolvedareasolid)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AngleEnd](../../aspose.threed.entities/revolvedareasolid/angleend) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the ending angle of the revolving procedure, measured in radian, default value is pi. |
| [AngleStart](../../aspose.threed.entities/revolvedareasolid/anglestart) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the starting angle of the revolving procedure, measured in radian, default value is 0. |
| [Axis](../../aspose.threed.entities/revolvedareasolid/axis) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the axis direction, default value is (0, 1, 0). |
| [Excluded](../../aspose.threed/entity/excluded) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| virtual [Name](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/name) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name. |
| [Origin](../../aspose.threed.entities/revolvedareasolid/origin) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the origin point of the revolving, default value is (0, 0, 0). |
| [ParentNode](../../aspose.threed/entity/parentnode) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [ParentNodes](../../aspose.threed/entity/parentnodes) { get; } | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [Properties](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/properties) { get; } | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [Scene](../../aspose.threed/sceneobject/scene) { get; } | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [Shape](../../aspose.threed.entities/revolvedareasolid/shape) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the base profile used to revolve. |
