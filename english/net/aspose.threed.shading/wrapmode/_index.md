public enum WrapMode
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |

| Wrap | `0` | Tiles the texture on the model's surface, creating a repeating pattern. |
| Clamp | `1` | Clamps the texture to the last pixel at the border. |
| Mirror | `2` | The texture will be repeated, but it will be mirrored when the integer part of the coordinate is odd. |
| MirrorOnce | `3` | The texture will be mirrored once, and then clamps to the maximum value. |
| Border | `4` | The coordinates that outside of the range [0.0, 1.0] are set to a specified border color. |
