## ArbitraryProfile class

This class allows you to construct a 2D profile directly from arbitrary curve.

```csharp
public class ArbitraryProfile : Profile
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ArbitraryProfile](arbitraryprofile/#constructor)() | Constructor of `ArbitraryProfile` |
| [ArbitraryProfile](arbitraryprofile/#constructor_1)(Curve) | Constructor of `ArbitraryProfile` with an initial curve. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Curve](../../aspose.threed.profiles/arbitraryprofile/curve/) { get; set; } | The Curve used to construct the profile |
| [Excluded](../../aspose.threed/entity/excluded/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting.(Inherited from [`Entity`](../../aspose.threed/entity/).) |
| virtual [Name](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/name/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the name.(Inherited from [`A3DObject`](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/).) |
| [ParentNode](../../aspose.threed/entity/parentnode/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes.(Inherited from [`Entity`](../../aspose.threed/entity/).) |
| [ParentNodes](../../aspose.threed/entity/parentnodes/) { get; } | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing(Inherited from [`Entity`](../../aspose.threed/entity/).) |
| [Properties](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/properties/) { get; } | Gets the collection of all properties.(Inherited from [`A3DObject`](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/).) |
| [Scene](../../aspose.threed/sceneobject/scene/) { get; } | Gets the scene that this object belongs to(Inherited from [`SceneObject`](../../aspose.threed/sceneobject/).) |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FindProperty](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/findproperty/)(string) | Finds the property. It can be a dynamic property (Created by CreateDynamicProperty/SetProperty) or native property(Identified by its name)(Inherited from [`A3DObject`](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/).) |
| [GetBoundingBox](../../aspose.threed/entity/getboundingbox/)() | Gets the bounding box of current entity in its object space coordinate system.(Inherited from [`Entity`](../../aspose.threed/entity/).) |
| override [GetEntityRendererKey](../../aspose.threed.profiles/profile/getentityrendererkey/)() | Gets the key of the entity renderer registered in the renderer(Inherited from [`Profile`](../profile/).) |
| [GetProperty](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/getproperty/)(string) | Get the value of specified property(Inherited from [`A3DObject`](../../aspose.threed/a3dobject/).) |
