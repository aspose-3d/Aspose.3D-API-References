All 2D profile classes are defined in this namespace.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ArbitraryProfile](./arbitraryprofile/) | This class allows you to construct a 2D profile directly from arbitrary curve. |
| [CenterLineProfile](./centerlineprofile/) | IFC compatible center line profile |
| [CircleShape](./circleshape/) | IFC compatible circle profile, which can be used to construct a mesh through [`LinearExtrusion`](../aspose.threed.entities/linearextrusion/) |
| [CShape](./cshape/) | IFC compatible C-shape profile that defined by parameters. The center position of the profile is in the center of the bounding box. |
| [EllipseShape](./ellipseshape/) | IFC compatible ellipse shape that defined by parameters. The center position of the profile is in the center of the bounding box. |
| [FontFile](./fontfile/) | Font file contains definitions for glyphs, this is used to create text profile. |
| [HollowCircleShape](./hollowcircleshape/) | IFC compatible hollow circle profile. |
| [HollowRectangleShape](./hollowrectangleshape/) | IFC compatible hollow rectangular shape with both inner/outer rounding corners. |
| [HShape](./hshape/) | The [`HShape`](../aspose.threed.profiles/hshape/) provides the defining parameters of an 'H' or 'I' shape. |
| [LShape](./lshape/) | IFC compatible L-shape profile that defined by parameters. |
| [MirroredProfile](./mirroredprofile/) | IFC compatible mirror profile. This profile defines a new profile by mirroring the base profile about the y axis. |
| [ParameterizedProfile](./parameterizedprofile/) | The base class of all parameterized profiles. |
| [Profile](./profile/) | 2D Profile in xy plane |
| [RectangleShape](./rectangleshape/) | IFC compatible rectangular shape with rounding corners. |
| [Text](./text/) | Text profile, this profile describes contours using font and text. |
| [TrapeziumShape](./trapeziumshape/) | IFC compatible Trapezium shape defined by parameters. |
| [TShape](./tshape/) | IFC compatible T-shape defined by parameters. |
| [UShape](./ushape/) | IFC compatible U-shape defined by parameters. |
| [ZShape](./zshape/) | IFC compatible Z-shape profile defined by parameters. |
