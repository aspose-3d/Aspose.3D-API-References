## PdfRenderMode enumeration

Render mode specifies the style in which the 3D artwork is rendered.

```csharp
public enum PdfRenderMode
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Solid | `0` | Displays textured and lit geometric shapes. |
| SolidWireframe | `1` | Displays textured and lit geometric shapes (triangles) with single color edges on top of them. |
| Transparent | `2` | Displays textured and lit geometric shapes (triangles) with an added level of transparency. |
| TransparentWireframe | `3` | Displays textured and lit geometric shapes (triangles) with an added level of transparency, with single color opaque edges on top of it. |
| BoundingBox | `4` | Displays the bounding box edges of each node, aligned with the axes of the local coordinate space for that node. |
| TransparentBoundingBox | `5` | Displays bounding boxes faces of each node, aligned with the axes of the local coordinate space for that node, with an added level of transparency. |
| TransparentBoundingBoxOutline | `6` | Displays bounding boxes edges and faces of each node, aligned with the axes of the local coordinate space for that node, with an added level of transparency. |
| Wireframe | `7` | Displays only edges in a single color. |
| ShadedWireframe | `8` | Displays only edges, though interpolates their color between their two vertices and applies lighting. |
| HiddenWireframe | `9` | Displays edges in a single color, though removes back-facing and obscured edges. |
| Vertices | `10` | Displays only vertices in a single color. |
| ShadedVertices | `11` | Displays only vertices, though uses their vertex color and applies lighting. |
| Illustration | `12` | Displays silhouette edges with surfaces, removes obscured lines. |
| SolidOutline | `13` | Displays silhouette edges with lit and textured surfaces, removes obscured lines. |
| ShadedIllustration | `14` | Displays silhouette edges with lit and textured surfaces and an additional emissive term to remove poorly lit areas of the artwork. |
