## Discreet3dsSaveOptions.HighPreciseColor property

If this is true, the generated 3ds file will use high precise color, means each channel of red/green/blue are in 32bit float. Otherwise the generated file will use 24bit color, each channel use 8bit byte. The default value is false, because not all applications supports the high-precise color.

```csharp
public bool HighPreciseColor { get; set; }
```
