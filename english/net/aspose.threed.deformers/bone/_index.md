## Bone class

A bone defines the subset of the geometry's control point, and defined blend weight for each control point. The [`Bone`](../bone) object cannot be used directly, a [`SkinDeformer`](../skindeformer) instance is used to deform the geometry, and [`SkinDeformer`](../skindeformer) comes with a set of bones, each bone linked to a node. NOTE: A control point of a geometry can be bounded to more than one Bones.

```csharp
public class Bone : A3DObject
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Bone](bone)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`Bone`](../bone) class. |
| [Bone](bone)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Bone`](../bone) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BoneTransform](bonetransform) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the transform matrix of the bone. |
| [Item](item) { get; set; } |  |
| [Node](node) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the node. The bone node is the bone which skin attached to, the [`SkinDeformer`](../skindeformer) will use bone node to influence the displacement of the control points. Bone node usually has a [`Skeleton`](../../aspose.threed.entities/skeleton) attached, but it's not required. Attached [`Skeleton`](../../aspose.threed.entities/skeleton) is usually used by DCC software to show skeleton to user. |
| [Transform](transform) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the transform matrix of the node containing the bone. |
| [WeightCount](weightcount) { get; } | Gets the count of weight, this is automatically extended by [`SetWeight`](./setweight) |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetWeight](getweight)(int) | Gets the weight for control point specified by index |
| [SetWeight](setweight)(int, double) | Sets the weight for control point specified by index |
