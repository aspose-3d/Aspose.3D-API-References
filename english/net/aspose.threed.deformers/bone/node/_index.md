## Bone.Node property

Gets or sets the node. The bone node is the bone which skin attached to, the [`SkinDeformer`](../../skindeformer) will use bone node to influence the displacement of the control points. Bone node usually has a [`Skeleton`](../../../aspose.threed.entities/skeleton) attached, but it's not required. Attached [`Skeleton`](../../../aspose.threed.entities/skeleton) is usually used by DCC software to show skeleton to user.

```csharp
public Node Node { get; set; }
```
