## Transform class

A transform contains information that allow access to object's translate/scale/rotation or transform matrix at minimum cost This is used by local transform.

```csharp
public class Transform : A3DObject
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EulerAngles](eulerangles) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the rotation represented in Euler angles, measured in degree |
| [GeometricRotation](geometricrotation) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the geometric Euler rotation(measured in degree). Geometric transformation only affects the entities attached and leave the child nodes unaffected. It will be merged as local transformation when you export the geometric transformation to file types that does not support it. |
| [GeometricScaling](geometricscaling) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the geometric scaling. Geometric transformation only affects the entities attached and leave the child nodes unaffected. It will be merged as local transformation when you export the geometric transformation to file types that does not support it. |
| [GeometricTranslation](geometrictranslation) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the geometric translation. Geometric transformation only affects the entities attached and leave the child nodes unaffected. It will be merged as local transformation when you export the geometric transformation to file types that does not support it. |
| [PostRotation](postrotation) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the post-rotation represented in degree |
| [PreRotation](prerotation) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the pre-rotation represented in degree |
| [Rotation](rotation) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the rotation represented in quaternion. |
| [Scale](scale) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the scale |
| [TransformMatrix](transformmatrix) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the transform matrix. |
| [Translation](translation) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the translation |
