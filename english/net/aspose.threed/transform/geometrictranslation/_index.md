## Transform.GeometricTranslation property

Gets or sets the geometric translation. Geometric transformation only affects the entities attached and leave the child nodes unaffected. It will be merged as local transformation when you export the geometric transformation to file types that does not support it.

```csharp
public Vector3 GeometricTranslation { get; set; }
```
