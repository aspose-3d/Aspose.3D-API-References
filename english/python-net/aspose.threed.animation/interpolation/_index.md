## Interpolation enumeration

The key frame's interpolation type.



The Interpolation type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| CONSTANT | The value will remains constant to the value of the first point until the next segment. |
| LINEAR | Linear interpolation is a straight line between two points. |
| BEZIER | A bezier or Hermite spline. |
| B_SPLINE | Basis splines are defined by a series of control points, for which the curve is guaranteed only to go through the first and the last point. |
| CARDINAL_SPLINE | A cardinal spline is a cubic Hermite spline whose tangents are defined by the endpoints and a tension parameter. |
| TCB_SPLINE | Also called Kochanek-Bartels spline, the behavior of tangent is defined by tension/bias/continuity |
