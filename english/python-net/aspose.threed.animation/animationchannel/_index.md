## AnimationChannel class

A channel maps property's component field to a set of keyframe sequences



The AnimationChannel type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [component_type](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.animation/animationchannel/component_type) | Gets the component field's type |
| [name](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.animation/animationchannel/name) | Gets the name of the channel |
| [default_value](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.animation/animationchannel/default_value) | Gets or sets the Default value of the channel.<br/>If a channel has no keyframe sequences connected, the default value will be used during the animation evaluation.<br/>A real scenario: Animation only animates a node's x coordinate, the y and z are not changed, <br/>then the default value will be used during full translation evaluation. |
| [keyframe_sequences](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.animation/animationchannel/keyframe_sequences) | Gets all keyframe sequences inside this channel |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [add_keyframe_sequence](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.animation/animationchannel/add_keyframe_sequence/#aspose.threed.animation.KeyframeSequence) | Adds keyframe sequence to this channel |
