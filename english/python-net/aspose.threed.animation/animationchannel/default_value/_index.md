## default_value property


Gets or sets the Default value of the channel.
            If a channel has no keyframe sequences connected, the default value will be used during the animation evaluation.
            A real scenario: Animation only animates a node's x coordinate, the y and z are not changed, 
            then the default value will be used during full translation evaluation.
