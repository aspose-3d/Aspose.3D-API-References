## SweptAreaSolid class

A [SweptAreaSolid](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid) constructs a geometry by sweeping a profile along a directrix.



**Inheritance:** [SweptAreaSolid](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid) → 
[Entity](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/entity) → 
[SceneObject](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/sceneobject) → 
[A3DObject](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/a3dobject)



The SweptAreaSolid type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [SweptAreaSolid()](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/__init__/#) | Initialize an SceneObject. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [name](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/name) | Gets or sets the name. |
| [properties](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/properties) | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [scene](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/scene) | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [parent_nodes](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/parent_nodes) | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [excluded](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/excluded) | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| [parent_node](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/parent_node) | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [shape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/shape) | The base profile to construct the geometry. |
| [directrix](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/directrix) | The directrix that the swept area sweeping along with. |
| [start_point](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/start_point) | The start point of the directrix. |
| [end_point](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/sweptareasolid/end_point) | The end point of the directrix. |
