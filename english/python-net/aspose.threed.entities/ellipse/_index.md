## Ellipse class

An [`Ellipse`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse) defines a set of points that form the shape of ellipse.



**Inheritance:** [`Ellipse`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse) → 
[`Curve`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/curve) → 
[`Entity`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/entity) → 
[`SceneObject`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/sceneobject) → 
[`A3DObject`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/a3dobject)



The Ellipse type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse/__init__/#) | Constructor of [`Ellipse`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse) |
| [__init__](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse/__init__/#float-float) | Constructor of [`Ellipse`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse) |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [name](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse/name) | Gets or sets the name. |
| [properties](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse/properties) | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [scene](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse/scene) | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [parent_nodes](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse/parent_nodes) | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [excluded](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse/excluded) | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| [parent_node](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/ellipse/parent_node) | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
