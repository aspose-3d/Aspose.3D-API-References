## EndPoint class

The end point to trim the curve, can be a parameter value or a Cartesian point.



The EndPoint type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint/__init__/#aspose.threed.utilities.Vector3) | Construct a [`EndPoint`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint) from a Cartesian point. |
| [__init__](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint/__init__/#float) | Construct a [`EndPoint`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint) from a real parameter. |
| [__init__](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of EndPoint |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [is_cartesian_point](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint/is_cartesian_point) | Is the end point a Cartesian point? |
| [as_point](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint/as_point) | Gets the end point as Cartesian point, or thrown an exception. |
| [as_value](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint/as_value) | Gets the end point as a real parameter, or throw an exception. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [from_degree](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint/from_degree/#float) | Create an end point measured in degree. |
| [from_radian](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/endpoint/from_radian/#float) | Create an end point measured in radian. |
