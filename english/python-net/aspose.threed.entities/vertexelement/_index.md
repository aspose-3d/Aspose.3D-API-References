## VertexElement class

Base class of vertex elements.
A vertex element type is identified by VertexElementType. 
A VertexElement describes how the vertex element is mapped to a geometry surface and how the mapping information is arranged in memory. 
A VertexElement contains Normals, UVs or other kind of information.



The VertexElement type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [vertex_element_type](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/vertexelement/vertex_element_type) | Gets the type of the [VertexElement](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/vertexelement) |
| [name](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/vertexelement/name) | Gets or sets the name. |
| [mapping_mode](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/vertexelement/mapping_mode) | Gets or sets how the element is mapped. |
| [reference_mode](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/vertexelement/reference_mode) | Gets or sets how the element is referenced. |
| [indices](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/vertexelement/indices) | Gets the indices data |


### Methods
