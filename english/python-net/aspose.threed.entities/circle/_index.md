## Circle class

A [`Circle`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle) curve consists of a set of points in the edge of the circle shape.



**Inheritance:** [`Circle`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle) → 
[`Curve`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/curve) → 
[`Entity`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/entity) → 
[`SceneObject`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/sceneobject) → 
[`A3DObject`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/a3dobject)



The Circle type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__(self)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/__init__/#) | Constructor of [`Circle`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle) |
| [`__init__(self, radius)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/__init__/#float) | Constructor of [`Circle`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle) |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [name](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/name) | Gets or sets the name. |
| [properties](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/properties) | Gets the collection of all properties. |
| [scene](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/scene) | Gets the scene that this object belongs to |
| [parent_nodes](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/parent_nodes) | Gets all parent nodes, an entity can be attached to multiple parent nodes for geometry instancing |
| [excluded](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/excluded) | Gets or sets whether to exclude this entity during exporting. |
| [parent_node](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/parent_node) | Gets or sets the first parent node, if set the first parent node, this entity will be detached from other parent nodes. |
| [color](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/color) | Gets or sets the color of the line, default value is white(1, 1, 1) |
| [radius](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/circle/radius) | The radius of the circle curve, default value is 10 |
