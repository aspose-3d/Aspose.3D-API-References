## rotation_mode property


Gets or sets the frustum's orientation mode
            This property only works when the [Frustum.target](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/frustum#target) is null.
            If the value is [RotationMode.FIXED_TARGET](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/rotationmode#FIXED_TARGET), the direction is always calculated by the property [Frustum.look_at](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/frustum#look_at)
            Otherwise the [Frustum.look_at](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/frustum#look_at) is always calculated by the [Frustum.direction](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/frustum#direction)
