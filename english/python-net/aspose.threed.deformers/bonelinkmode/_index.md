## BoneLinkMode enumeration

A bone's link mode refers to the way in which a bone is connected or linked to its parent bone within a hierarchical structure.



The BoneLinkMode type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NORMALIZE | In this mode, the transformations of child bones are normalized concerning their parent bone's transformations. |
| ADDITIVE | Additive mode calculates the transformations of child bones by adding their own local transformations to those of their parent bones. |
| TOTAL_ONE | Total One ensures that combined transformations of the parent and child bones result in a combined transformation that scales to an overall length of one unit. |
