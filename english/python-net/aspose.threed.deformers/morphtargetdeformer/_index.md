## MorphTargetDeformer class

MorphTargetDeformer provides per-vertex animation.
MorphTargetDeformer organize all targets via [`MorphTargetChannel`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.deformers/morphtargetchannel), each channel can organize multiple targets.
A common use of morph target deformer is to apply facial expression to a character.
