## GlobalTransform class

Global transform is similar to [Transform](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/transform) but it's immutable while it represents the final evaluated transformation.
Right-hand coordinate system is used while evaluating global transform



The GlobalTransform type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [translation](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/globaltransform/translation) | Gets the translation |
| [scale](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/globaltransform/scale) | Gets the scale |
| [euler_angles](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/globaltransform/euler_angles) | Gets the rotation represented in Euler angles, measured in degree |
| [rotation](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/globaltransform/rotation) | Gets the rotation represented in quaternion. |
| [transform_matrix](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/globaltransform/transform_matrix) | Gets the transform matrix. |
