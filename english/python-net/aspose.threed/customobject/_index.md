## CustomObject class

Meta data or custom objects used in 3D files are managed by this class.
All custom properties are saved as dynamic properties.



**Inheritance:** [`CustomObject`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/customobject) → 
[`A3DObject`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/a3dobject)



The CustomObject type exposes the following members:
