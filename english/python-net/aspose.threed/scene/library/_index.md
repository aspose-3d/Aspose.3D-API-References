## library property


Objects that not directly used in scene hierarchy can be defined in Library.
This is useful when you're using sub-scenes and put reusable components under sub-scenes.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def library(self):
    ...
```

### See Also
* module [`aspose.threed`](../../)
* class [`Scene`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/scene)
