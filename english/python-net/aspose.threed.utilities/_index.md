### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`BoundingBox`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox) | The axis-aligned bounding box |
| [`BoundingBox2D`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d) | The axis-aligned bounding box for [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) |
| [`DummyFileSystem`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/dummyfilesystem) | Read/write operations are dummy operations. |
| [`FMatrix4`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fmatrix4) | Matrix 4x4 with all component in float type |
| [`FVector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector2) | A float vector with two components. |
| [`FVector3`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3) | A float vector with three components. |
| [`FVector4`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector4) | A float vector with four components. |
| [`FileSystem`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/filesystem) | File system encapsulation.<br/>Aspose.3D will use this to read/write dependencies. |
| [`IOUtils`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/ioutils) | Utilities to write matrix/vector to binary writer |
| [`LocalFileSystem`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/localfilesystem) | The [`LocalFileSystem`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/localfilesystem) will maps the read/write operations to local directory. |
| [`MathUtils`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/mathutils) | A set of useful mathematical utilities. |
| [`Matrix4`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/matrix4) | 4x4 matrix implementation. |
| [`MemoryFileSystem`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/memoryfilesystem) | The [`MemoryFileSystem`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/memoryfilesystem) will maps the read/write operations to memory. |
| [`ParseException`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/parseexception) | Exception when Aspose.3D failed to parse the input. |
| [`Quaternion`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion) | Quaternion is usually used to perform rotation in computer graphics. |
| [`Rect`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/rect) | A class to represent the rectangle |
| [`RelativeRectangle`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/relativerectangle) | Relative rectangle<br/>The formula between relative component to absolute value is:<br/>Scale * (Reference Width) + offset<br/>So if we want it to represent an absolute value, leave all scale fields zero, and use offset fields instead. |
| [`SemanticAttribute`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/semanticattribute) | Allow user to use their own structure for static declaration of [`VertexDeclaration`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration) |
| [`TransformBuilder`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/transformbuilder) | The [`TransformBuilder`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/transformbuilder) is used to build transform matrix by a chain of transformations. |
| [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) | A vector with two components. |
| [`Vector3`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector3) | A vector with three components. |
| [`Vector4`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector4) | A vector with four components. |
| [`Vertex`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vertex) | Vertex reference, used to access the raw vertex in [`TriMesh`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/trimesh). |
| [`VertexDeclaration`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vertexdeclaration) | The declaration of a custom defined vertex's structure |
| [`VertexField`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vertexfield) | Vertex's field memory layout description. |
| [`Watermark`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/watermark) | Utility to encode/decode blind watermark  to/from a mesh. |
| [`ZipArchiveFileSystem`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/ziparchivefilesystem) | File system to provide to the read-only access to speicified zip file or zip stream.<br/>File system will be disposed after the open/save operation. |


### Enumerations
| Enumeration | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`BoundingBoxExtent`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingboxextent) | The extent of the bounding box |
| [`ComposeOrder`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/composeorder) | The order to compose transform matrix |
| [`RotationOrder`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/rotationorder) | The order controls which rx ry rz are applied in the transformation matrix. |
| [`VertexFieldDataType`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vertexfielddatatype) | Vertex field's data type |
