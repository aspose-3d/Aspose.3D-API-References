## angle_between {#aspose.threed.utilities.Vector3}

Calculate the inner angle between two direction
Two direction can be non-normalized vectors


### Returns 


inner angle in radian


```python
def angle_between(self, dir):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| dir | [`Vector3`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector3) | The direction vector to compare with |
