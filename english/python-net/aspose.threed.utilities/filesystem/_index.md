## FileSystem class

File system encapsulation.
Aspose.3D will use this to read/write dependencies.



The FileSystem type exposes the following members:

### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [create_zip_file_system](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/filesystem/create_zip_file_system/#io.RawIOBase-str) | Create a file system to provide to the read-only access to speicified zip file or zip stream.<br/>File system will be disposed after the open/save operation. |
| [create_zip_file_system](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/filesystem/create_zip_file_system/#str) | File system to provide to the read-only access to speicified zip file or zip stream.<br/>File system will be disposed after the open/save operation. |
| [read_file](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/filesystem/read_file/#str-aspose.threed.formats.IOConfig) | Create a stream for reading dependencies. |
| [write_file](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/filesystem/write_file/#str-aspose.threed.formats.IOConfig) | Create a stream for writing dependencies. |
| [create_local_file_system](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/filesystem/create_local_file_system/#str) | Initialize a new [`FileSystem`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/filesystem) that only access local directory.<br/>All file read/write on this FileSystem instance will be mapped to specified directory. |
| [create_dummy_file_system](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/filesystem/create_dummy_file_system/#) | Create a dummy file system, read/write operations are dummy operations. |
