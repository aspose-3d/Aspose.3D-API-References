## BoundingBox class

The axis-aligned bounding box



The BoundingBox type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/__init__/#aspose.threed.utilities.Vector3-aspose.threed.utilities.Vector3) | Initialize a finite bounding box with given minimum and maximum corner |
| [__init__](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/__init__/#float-float-float-float-float-float) | Initialize a finite bounding box with given minimum and maximum corner |
| [__init__](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of BoundingBox |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [extent](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/extent) | Gets the extent of the bounding box. |
| [minimum](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/minimum) | The minimum corner of the bounding box |
| [maximum](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/maximum) | The maximum corner of the bounding box |
| [size](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/size) | The size of the bounding box |
| [center](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/center) | The center of the bounding box. |
| [NULL](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/null) | The null bounding box |
| [INFINITE](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/infinite) | The infinite bounding box |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [merge](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/merge/#aspose.threed.utilities.Vector4) | Merge current bounding box with given point |
| [merge](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/merge/#aspose.threed.utilities.Vector3) | Merge current bounding box with given point |
| [merge](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/merge/#float-float-float) | Merge current bounding box with given point |
| [merge](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/merge/#aspose.threed.utilities.BoundingBox) | Merges the new box into the current bounding box. |
| [scale](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/scale/#) | Calculates the absolute largest coordinate value of any contained point. |
| [from_geometry](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/from_geometry/#aspose.threed.entities.Geometry) | Construct a bounding box from given geometry |
| [overlaps_with](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/overlaps_with/#aspose.threed.utilities.BoundingBox) | Check if current bounding box overlaps with specified bounding box. |
| [contains](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/contains/#aspose.threed.utilities.Vector3) | Check if the point p is inside the bounding box |
