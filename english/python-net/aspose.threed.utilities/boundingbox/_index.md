## BoundingBox class

The axis-aligned bounding box



The BoundingBox type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [BoundingBox(minimum, maximum)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/__init__/#Vector3-Vector3) | Initialize a finite bounding box with given minimum and maximum corner |
| [BoundingBox(min_x, min_y, min_z, max_x, max_y, max_z)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/__init__/#float-float-float-float-float-float) | Initialize a finite bounding box with given minimum and maximum corner |
| [BoundingBox()](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/__init__/#) |  |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [extent](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/extent) | Gets the extent of the bounding box. |
| [minimum](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/minimum) | The minimum corner of the bounding box |
| [maximum](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/maximum) | The maximum corner of the bounding box |
| [size](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/size) | The size of the bounding box |
| [center](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/center) | The center of the bounding box. |
| [NULL](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox/NULL) |  |
