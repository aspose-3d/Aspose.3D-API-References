## Vector2 class

A vector with two components.



The Vector2 type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__(self, s)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#float) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) struct. |
| [`__init__(self, s)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#aspose.threed.utilities.vector3) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) struct. |
| [`__init__(self, vec)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#aspose.threed.utilities.fvector2) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) struct. |
| [`__init__(self, x, y)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#float-float) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) struct. |
| [`__init__(self)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of Vector2 |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [u](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/u) | Gets or sets the U component if the [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) is used as a mapping coordinate.<br/>It's an alias of x component. |
| [v](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/v) | Gets or sets the V component if the [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) is used as a mapping coordinate.<br/>It's an alias of y component. |
| [length](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/length) | Gets the length. |
| [x](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/x) | The x component. |
| [y](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/y) | The y component. |


### Methods

| :- | :- |
| [`dot(self, rhs)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/dot/#aspose.threed.utilities.vector2) | Gets the dot product of two vectors |
| [`equals(self, rhs)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/equals/#aspose.threed.utilities.vector2) | Check if two vector2 equals |
| [`cross(self, v)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/cross/#aspose.threed.utilities.vector2) | Cross product of two vectors |
