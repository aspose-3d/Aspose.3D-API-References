## Vector2 class

A vector with two components.



The Vector2 type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Vector2(s)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#float) | Initializes a new instance of the [Vector2](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) struct. |
| [Vector2(vec)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#FVector2) | Initializes a new instance of the [Vector2](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) struct. |
| [Vector2(x, y)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#float-float) | Initializes a new instance of the [Vector2](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) struct. |
| [Vector2()](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of Vector2 |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [u](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/u) | Gets or sets the U component if the [Vector2](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) is used as a mapping coordinate.<br/>It's an alias of x component. |
| [v](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/v) | Gets or sets the V component if the [Vector2](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2) is used as a mapping coordinate.<br/>It's an alias of y component. |
| [length](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/length) | Gets the length. |
| [x](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/x) | The x component. |
| [y](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/y) | The y component. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [dot(rhs)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/dot/#Vector2) | Gets the dot product of two vectors |
| [equals(rhs)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/equals/#Vector2) | Check if two vector2 equals |
| [cross(v)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/cross/#Vector2) | Cross product of two vectors |
| [normalize()](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/normalize/#) | Normalizes this instance. |
| [compare_to(other)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2/compare_to/#Vector2) | Compare current vector to another instance. |
