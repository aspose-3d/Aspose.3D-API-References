## FVector3 class

A float vector with three components.



The FVector3 type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [FVector3(x, y, z)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/__init__/#float-float-float) | Initializes a new instance of the [FVector3](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3). |
| [FVector3(vec)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/__init__/#Vector3) | Initializes a new instance of the [FVector3](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3). |
| [FVector3(vec)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/__init__/#Vector4) | Initializes a new instance of the [FVector4](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector4). |
| [FVector3()](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of FVector3 |
