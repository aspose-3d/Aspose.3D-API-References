## FVector3 class

A float vector with three components.



The FVector3 type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__(self, x, y, z)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/__init__/#float-float-float) | Initializes a new instance of the [`FVector3`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3). |
| [`__init__(self, vec)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/__init__/#aspose.threed.utilities.vector3) | Initializes a new instance of the [`FVector3`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3). |
| [`__init__(self, vec)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/__init__/#aspose.threed.utilities.vector4) | Initializes a new instance of the [`FVector4`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector4). |
| [`__init__(self)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of FVector3 |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [zero](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/zero) | The Zero vector. |
| [one](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/one) | The unit scale vector with all components are all 1 |
| [x](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/fvector3/x) | The x component. |
