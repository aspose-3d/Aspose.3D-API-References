## BoundingBox2D class

The axis-aligned bounding box for [Vector2](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2)



The BoundingBox2D type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [BoundingBox2D(minimum, maximum)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/__init__/#Vector2-Vector2) | Initialize a finite bounding box with given minimum and maximum corner |
| [BoundingBox2D()](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/__init__/#) |  |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [extent](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/extent) | Gets the extent of the bounding box. |
| [minimum](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/minimum) | The minimum corner of the bounding box |
| [maximum](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/maximum) | The maximum corner of the bounding box |
| [NULL](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/NULL) |  |
| [INFINITE](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/INFINITE) |  |


### Methods
