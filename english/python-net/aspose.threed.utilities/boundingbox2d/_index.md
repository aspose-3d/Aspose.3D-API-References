## BoundingBox2D class

The axis-aligned bounding box for [`Vector2`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/vector2)



The BoundingBox2D type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__(self, minimum, maximum)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/__init__/#aspose.threed.utilities.vector2-aspose.threed.utilities.vector2) | Initialize a finite bounding box with given minimum and maximum corner |
| [`__init__(self)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of BoundingBox2D |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [extent](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/extent) | Gets the extent of the bounding box. |
| [minimum](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/minimum) | The minimum corner of the bounding box |
| [maximum](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/maximum) | The maximum corner of the bounding box |
| [NULL](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/null) | The null bounding box |
| [INFINITE](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/infinite) | The infinite bounding box |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`merge(self, pt)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/merge/#aspose.threed.utilities.vector2) | Merges the new box into the current bounding box. |
| [`merge(self, bb)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.utilities/boundingbox2d/merge/#aspose.threed.utilities.boundingbox2d) | Merges the new box into the current bounding box. |
