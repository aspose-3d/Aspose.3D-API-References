## LoadOptions class

The base class to configure options in file loading for different types



**Inheritance:** [`LoadOptions`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.formats/loadoptions) → 
[`IOConfig`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.formats/ioconfig)



The LoadOptions type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [file_format](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.formats/loadoptions/file_format) | Gets the file format that specified in current Save/Load option. |
| [encoding](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.formats/loadoptions/encoding) | Gets or sets the default encoding for text-based files.<br/>Default value is null which means the importer/exporter will decide which encoding to use. |
| [file_system](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.formats/loadoptions/file_system) | Allow user to handle how to manage the external dependencies during load/save. |
| [lookup_paths](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.formats/loadoptions/lookup_paths) | Some files like OBJ depends on external file, the lookup paths will allows Aspose.3D to look for external file to load. |
| [file_name](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.formats/loadoptions/file_name) | The file name of the exporting/importing scene.<br/>This is optional, but useful when serialize external assets like OBJ's material. |
