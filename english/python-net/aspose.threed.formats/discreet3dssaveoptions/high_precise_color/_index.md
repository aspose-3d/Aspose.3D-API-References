## high_precise_color property


If this is true, the generated 3ds file will use high precise color, means each channel of red/green/blue are in 32bit float.
Otherwise the generated file will use 24bit color, each channel use 8bit byte.
The default value is false, because not all applications supports the high-precise color.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def high_precise_color(self):
    ...
@high_precise_color.setter
def high_precise_color(self, value):
    ...
```
