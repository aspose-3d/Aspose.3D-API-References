All 2D profile classes are defined in this namespace.

### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [ArbitraryProfile](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/arbitraryprofile) | This class allows you to construct a 2D profile directly from arbitrary curve. |
| [CShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/cshape) | IFC compatible C-shape profile that defined by parameters.<br/>            The center position of the profile is in the center of the bounding box. |
| [CircleShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/circleshape) | IFC compatible circle profile, which can be used to construct a mesh through [LinearExtrusion](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/linearextrusion) |
| [EllipseShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/ellipseshape) | IFC compatible ellipse shape that defined by parameters.<br/>            The center position of the profile is in the center of the bounding box. |
| [HShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/hshape) | The [HShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/hshape) provides the defining parameters of an 'H' or 'I' shape. |
| [HollowCircleShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/hollowcircleshape) | IFC compatible hollow circle profile. |
| [HollowRectangleShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/hollowrectangleshape) | IFC compatible hollow rectangular shape with both inner/outer rounding corners. |
| [LShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/lshape) | IFC compatible L-shape profile that defined by parameters. |
| [MirroredProfile](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/mirroredprofile) | IFC compatible mirror profile.<br/>            This profile defines a new profile by mirroring the base profile about the y axis. |
| [ParameterizedProfile](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/parameterizedprofile) | The base class of all parameterized profiles. |
| [Profile](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/profile) | 2D Profile in xy plane |
| [RectangleShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/rectangleshape) | IFC compatible rectangular shape with rounding corners. |
| [TShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/tshape) | IFC compatible T-shape defined by parameters. |
| [TrapeziumShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/trapeziumshape) | IFC compatible Trapezium shape defined by parameters. |
| [UShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/ushape) | IFC compatible U-shape defined by parameters. |
| [ZShape](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.profiles/zshape) | IFC compatible Z-shape profile defined by parameters. |
