## ITextureUnit class

[ITextureUnit](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit) represents a texture in the memory that shared between GPU and CPU and can be sampled by the shader,
where the [Texture](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.shading/texture) only represents a reference to an external file.
More details can be found https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping_unit



The ITextureUnit type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [type](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/type) | Gets the type of this texture unit. |
| [width](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/width) | Gets the width of this texture. |
| [height](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/height) | Gets the height of this texture. |
| [depth](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/depth) | Gets the height of this texture, for none-3D texture it's always 1. |
| [u_wrap](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/u_wrap) | Gets or sets the wrap mode for texture's U coordinate. |
| [v_wrap](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/v_wrap) | Gets or sets the wrap mode for texture's V coordinate. |
| [w_wrap](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/w_wrap) | Gets or sets the wrap mode for texture's W coordinate. |
| [minification](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/minification) | Gets or sets the filter mode for minification. |
| [magnification](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/magnification) | Gets or sets the filter mode for magnification. |
| [mipmap](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/mipmap) | Gets or sets the filter mode for mipmap. |
| [scroll](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/scroll) | Gets or sets the scroll of the UV coordinate. |
| [scale](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/itextureunit/scale) | Gets or sets the scale of the UV coordinate. |
