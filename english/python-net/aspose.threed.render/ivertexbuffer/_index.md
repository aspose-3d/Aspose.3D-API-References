## IVertexBuffer class

The vertex buffer holds the polygon vertex data that will be sent to rendering pipeline



The IVertexBuffer type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [vertex_declaration](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/ivertexbuffer/vertex_declaration) | Gets the vertex declaration |
| [size](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/ivertexbuffer/size) | Size of this buffer in bytes |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [load_data](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/ivertexbuffer/load_data/#aspose.threed.entities.TriMesh) | Load vertex data from [`TriMesh`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/trimesh) |
| [load_data](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/ivertexbuffer/load_data/#Array) |  |
| [load_data](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/ivertexbuffer/load_data/#bytes) | Load the data into current buffer |
