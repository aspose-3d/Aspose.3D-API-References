## PushConstant class

A utility to provide data to shader through push constant.



The PushConstant type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__(self)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/__init__/#) | Constructor of the [`PushConstant`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant) |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`write(self, mat)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#aspose.threed.utilities.fmatrix4) | Write the matrix to the constant |
| [`write(self, n)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#int) | Write a int value to the constant |
| [`write(self, f)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#float) | Write a float value to the constant |
| [`write(self, vec)`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#aspose.threed.utilities.fvector4) | Write a 4-component vector to the constant |
