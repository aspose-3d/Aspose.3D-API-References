## PushConstant class

A utility to provide data to shader through push constant.



The PushConstant type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [PushConstant()](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/__init__/#) | Constructor of the [`PushConstant`](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant) |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [write(mat)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#aspose.threed.utilities.FMatrix4) | Write the matrix to the constant |
| [write(n)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#int) | Write a int value to the constant |
| [write(f)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#float) | Write a float value to the constant |
| [write(vec)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#aspose.threed.utilities.FVector4) | Write a 4-component vector to the constant |
| [write(vec)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#aspose.threed.utilities.FVector3) | Write a 3-component vector to the constant |
| [write(x, y, z, w)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/write/#float-float-float-float) | Write a 4-component vector to the constant |
| [commit(stage, command_list)](/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.render/pushconstant/commit/#ShaderStage-ICommandList) | Commit prepared data to graphics pipeline. |
